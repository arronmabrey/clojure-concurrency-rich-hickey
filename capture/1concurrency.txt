000m 00s --> 000m 05s
hi welcome a thank you for waiting um my name is Ricky and I'm here to talk about

000m 15s --> 000m 20s
saw the number from one of which was how to write concurring

000m 20s --> 000m 25s
programs in the way of soda

000m 30s --> 000m 35s
cat some of the concurrency to Fort Worth

000m 45s --> 000m 50s
is look at a PC software written closer and so I

000m 50s --> 000m 55s
uh I'd like hopefully I can move it a good pace

001m 00s --> 001m 05s
showing you and then look at some coding hopefully we'll have more opportunity to look into it

001m 05s --> 001m 10s
closure and service of features were looking at this program uh

001m 15s --> 001m 20s
uh then I'm going to set up for the problem space in particular

001m 20s --> 001m 25s
about your state how are you today how you doing in the shop Java

001m 30s --> 001m 35s
text and Pacific Lee what is the sum of the car in solution for that in those

001m 35s --> 001m 40s
locking vertical a um that's something I've done a lot of

001m 45s --> 001m 50s
because it fits Assembly of artifical

001m 50s --> 001m 55s
so of innocence run in there uh and

002m 00s --> 002m 05s
try to solve this problem the number different ways the restaurant Jacksonville

002m 05s --> 002m 10s
pictures of closer um and then we'll do the walkthrough look it up

002m 15s --> 002m 20s
the components in for that would generally be hot hard to do correctly

002m 20s --> 002m 25s
I'm off the common languages and I hope it wasn't a question question

002m 30s --> 002m 35s
early going but at any point you have a question they suck

002m 35s --> 002m 40s
uh so I'm a talking about for the things scheduling

002m 45s --> 002m 50s
uh election protection systems and machine listening

002m 50s --> 002m 55s
software architect uh and specialize in

003m 00s --> 003m 05s
like that I work in Los Angelas the sharp

003m 05s --> 003m 10s
platica con list uh iPhone

003m 15s --> 003m 20s
Kylie of where you're at so I know what not to bother with what you

003m 25s --> 003m 30s
war game about half

003m 35s --> 003m 40s
thank everybody does that anybody with any an hour half

003m 45s --> 003m 50s
Python Ruby groovy okay how about closer

003m 50s --> 003m 55s
when using a try in closer couple of people in the room okay that's neat

004m 00s --> 004m 05s
half so those are the people who grown in a knowledge mint

004m 05s --> 004m 10s
place a great the Greater Lansing

004m 15s --> 004m 20s
end of the few people here who have that will be the one not in an egg knowledge

004m 20s --> 004m 25s
some of us I think of when will you come to closing I'll see it

004m 30s --> 004m 35s
um but I got people coming closer from FEMA never use Java

004m 35s --> 004m 40s
what's the word put it in water what is Java

004m 45s --> 004m 50s
you're from Java who wrote what is less for all the presents is everything else is

004m 50s --> 004m 55s
is many people coming from and I'll have to look what time you figure

005m 00s --> 005m 05s
uh but a lot of closures inspired particular buy a house

005m 05s --> 005m 10s
NNN ello ello also it's a definite thing and for tonight

005m 15s --> 005m 20s
what clothes are kind of place in the same space as possible Ruben grooving a dynamic

005m 20s --> 005m 25s
language uh the successful I think of

005m 30s --> 005m 35s
this is useful in any context in which you jizz Java not just for something like

005m 35s --> 005m 40s
problem fundamentals of closure

005m 45s --> 005m 50s
programming in the inlet set or steam and you can move the bike invented

005m 50s --> 005m 55s
work good habit of a closure is functional for like the way I melt function

006m 00s --> 006m 05s
structures are immutable um and that has a lot of

006m 05s --> 006m 10s
value to program other than a particular value when we talk about

006m 15s --> 006m 20s
so its functional as a mutable persistent instructions I'll explain what data Circle

006m 20s --> 006m 25s
this is a little later uh no mutable local variable 02 true

006m 30s --> 006m 35s
it's much more functional than most lift um probably the most functional

006m 40s --> 006m 45s
I'm left uh oh and uh and I would say a characteristic of a list

006m 50s --> 006m 55s
um that there's a reader that the language is the final terms of the

007m 00s --> 007m 05s
Asin sex for you know a grammar with characters and closures list

007m 05s --> 007m 10s
NFS what is a many other ways it does have friends season of succession

007m 15s --> 007m 20s
not common with first name I'm not going to have enough time in tonight I thought

007m 20s --> 007m 25s
how to draw a lot of contrast the one thing I would say is when I get people coming to closer

007m 30s --> 007m 35s
play too I'm not supposed to say you're going to look at things are you using the same name

007m 35s --> 007m 40s
office in Texas for different meanings almost opposite meaning

007m 45s --> 007m 50s
other reasons why I use the names I do one of the reasons is the wrong with

007m 50s --> 007m 55s
pretty good thing they have to me what time it was so they need for ever never never

008m 00s --> 008m 05s
they have a code because it looks interesting friends around the Sun

008m 05s --> 008m 10s
bird uh take a step back maybe what you're supposed to be correct if it really

008m 15s --> 008m 20s
where is not coming with us email is no backwards compatibility with those things it makes no

008m 20s --> 008m 25s
Papa's I'm so brain total of the new list

008m 30s --> 008m 35s
the rationale part of this talk so I can get the concurrency things but uh I believe

008m 35s --> 008m 40s
important for new languages to embrace a platform like dot net worth this area

008m 45s --> 008m 50s
everything the same openings database talking about soccer

008m 50s --> 008m 55s
is no reason to do that languages in the library is a girlfriend look like

009m 00s --> 009m 05s
the fair to say what's up a job

009m 05s --> 009m 10s
Hughes library of there a fix that though that matter

009m 15s --> 009m 20s
with that are hosted for the fun see in that you're

009m 20s --> 009m 25s
posting language shares a memory model in the garbage collector with your ####

009m 30s --> 009m 35s
essentially a now a really nice and you'll see the closer

009m 35s --> 009m 40s
Residence JBR in a bike directions Lee quite offensive way uh and

009m 45s --> 009m 50s
functional programming left a big house on Java in the 4th is

009m 50s --> 009m 55s
a confederacy direct support for concurrency for this for conspiracy and it is

010m 00s --> 010m 05s
instructions of life blast off closer that is open source in

010m 05s --> 010m 10s
full downloadable version uh you can park

010m 15s --> 010m 20s
I forgot to quickly do mostly in Newark

010m 20s --> 010m 25s
the closer uh briefly before we go again

010m 30s --> 010m 35s
I has a reader in particular closure is not interpreted

010m 35s --> 010m 40s
old is compiled everything you enter the value weighted by a closer is compiled

010m 45s --> 010m 50s
um there's no interpreter in closer uh has all of it

010m 50s --> 010m 55s
primitive number is arbitrary precision injectors Easter for Less ratio

011m 00s --> 011m 05s
rings of symbols to words as Red Sox liberals and some other things like that

011m 05s --> 011m 10s
um in addition closer has a set of aggregates has a class

011m 15s --> 011m 20s
difference being that there a guaranteed a mutable persistence

011m 20s --> 011m 25s
no set car a reply karo anything like that

011m 30s --> 011m 35s
as with Arin list set up too fast uh

011m 35s --> 011m 40s
which means it mass are readable does the reader syntax for the spring

011m 45s --> 011m 50s
are a persistent immutable I go to talk about a lil bit

011m 50s --> 011m 55s
pull all of the data types in clothes are represented by attractions there are in

012m 00s --> 012m 05s
additionally of a whole library around consoles about it hard wife

012m 05s --> 012m 10s
consoles and the new MINI Cooper for a street bike on with the ability to them

012m 15s --> 012m 20s
of the District of the fun by interfaces in all of this useful library

012m 20s --> 012m 25s
is the final terms of attractions out of sorts of countries think of

012m 30s --> 012m 35s
logical thing called the sequence and the secret society Portland

012m 35s --> 012m 40s
data types of strings of all the Java Collections a fifth

012m 45s --> 012m 50s
not a list a closer to 14

012m 50s --> 012m 55s
edited as a first class in to see the new the bility do so she related data with the data

013m 00s --> 013m 05s
contain 1234 there any cool but this sector can have a piece of data that says

013m 10s --> 013m 15s
on the road outside and the there is cool the values are equal

013m 20s --> 013m 25s
68 issues but you can use in your own programs to check sources like I just a free

013m 30s --> 013m 35s
things that are not really part of their value probably are about the data

013m 35s --> 013m 40s
meditative mean does the recommended that support for all of the interesting data structures

013m 45s --> 013m 50s
closest to the unique and have a minute I had to take a list

013m 50s --> 013m 55s
function for first class data types closures a it has a

014m 00s --> 014m 05s
optimization enough because the JVM doesn't and closer

014m 05s --> 014m 10s
uses the JVM calling architecture of both for performance

014m 15s --> 014m 20s
All Seasons Java stack um but that the B side of that is that I can

014m 20s --> 014m 25s
do calculus vision as in steam which means I can offer a

014m 30s --> 014m 35s
also a closer has the first class functional live in construct

014m 35s --> 014m 40s
cursive and is functional and feels exactly like you would do without walls

014m 45s --> 014m 50s
JVM and if it's quite pretty I think um

014m 50s --> 014m 55s
so how's that I have an extensive destruction binding system nothing

015m 00s --> 015m 05s
Woodbine variable it was the name of that you cannot put in Berryville

015m 05s --> 015m 10s
putting things look like data structures that mirror the data structure of your getting past

015m 15s --> 015m 20s
call the structuring in college Valvoline macros system and as a

015m 20s --> 015m 25s
pantalones function called the structuring find a

015m 30s --> 015m 35s
and loop which means that all those concerts candy store for the Rogers

015m 35s --> 015m 40s
very interesting things including sequences generally and the maps

015m 45s --> 015m 50s
if you have pattern matching undies in this is half of that

015m 50s --> 015m 55s
whats up the part that I do about that I don't like with this is conditional

016m 00s --> 016m 05s
44 uh it has not gross and they're coming with by macro

016m 05s --> 016m 10s
Bobo closer is a list what a physically there a Arizona

016m 15s --> 016m 20s
what we are without having hygienic macros without have been a disaster that's why club

016m 20s --> 016m 25s
a list two separate newspaper function of what is up with this is a

016m 30s --> 016m 35s
new faces with clothes are done so you can segment your name is in a sec

016m 35s --> 016m 40s
the other thing that you need to solve this problem by having for public

016m 45s --> 016m 50s
symbols and variables in in time

016m 50s --> 016m 55s
what's the score unified field theory to read the Christmas day to self

017m 00s --> 017m 05s
bulls and symbols are just double doors of this is it called bars in

017m 05s --> 017m 10s
does your eye twitch compilation will find given the symbol varta with your car

017m 15s --> 017m 20s
file macros uh and there for the love of power

017m 20s --> 017m 25s
what are Charlie powerful because you're right little program form what is the code

017m 30s --> 017m 35s
who is this is the way of doing polymorphism up without any her to a

017m 35s --> 017m 40s
the complete general sense leave a function in a text argument

017m 45s --> 017m 50s
depends on the type to compose the tenant values of the argument serving Arbor trail way to do

017m 50s --> 017m 55s
batch so if you're familiar with the virtual

018m 00s --> 018m 05s
the genera close in other ways to say hi for value of

018m 05s --> 018m 10s
the argument a multi message to pick up one step further they say this message

018m 15s --> 018m 20s
value the can go after the database this is a special

018m 20s --> 018m 25s
value dispatching happens on that it's probably impossible

018m 30s --> 018m 35s
so its pretty powerful and very flexible for the ticket because its independence

018m 35s --> 018m 40s
Paris Hill SC the divide up your of data space in tomorrow

018m 45s --> 018m 50s
program that's easy closer ankles asking for the support

018m 50s --> 018m 55s
really a lot about um or more Java

019m 00s --> 019m 05s
you can certainly call methods of any Java classes in physics classes act

019m 05s --> 019m 10s
field of Axis race traitor raise them up im anything

019m 15s --> 019m 20s
interfaces in class is this the last is it implements of those classes

019m 20s --> 019m 25s
that will fill that in the demo program the whole sequence

019m 30s --> 019m 35s
so you can write algorithms in closure that manipulate close is logical sequence

019m 35s --> 019m 40s
brothers will work on Java springs drive arrays anything to stop a collection

019m 45s --> 019m 50s
is this in going the other way where is appropriate closure data structures

019m 50s --> 019m 55s
Java interface is all the clothes Russians are coming the read only for support

020m 00s --> 020m 05s
of course in interface a closer functions are called

020m 05s --> 020m 10s
so you can just passed the right to the executor's framework to execute them in resin

020m 15s --> 020m 20s
upper bowl third federal so others a great ability to create some data for free

020m 20s --> 020m 25s
buzzer ahead of the job and have to be able to uh consumer

020m 30s --> 020m 35s
uh and much much more that has is this is a message has functional tree

020m 35s --> 020m 40s
zippers XML Ford and email inspect

020m 45s --> 020m 50s
look at the website find out more about it we'll see

020m 50s --> 020m 55s
lots of this is the program enough

021m 00s --> 021m 05s
fast okay

021m 05s --> 021m 10s
okay

021m 15s --> 021m 20s
uh which is OK cuz I was a drunken weeworld

021m 20s --> 021m 25s
run I think what is the weather in the drawer

021m 30s --> 021m 35s
definitely an active insanity uh to do

021m 35s --> 021m 40s
uh what what is the drug me too it is that I am completely convinced that

021m 45s --> 021m 50s
by the design of Java the sharp Python all the layers of the following

021m 50s --> 021m 55s
long this path is this is the very much

022m 00s --> 022m 05s
what is the wrong way to do most things um utiliser for the new spaghetti code

022m 05s --> 022m 10s
uh and by that I mean that you invest Lea with me to life

022m 15s --> 022m 20s
get rid of that calculation just means wont charge of this message

022m 20s --> 022m 25s
about the real that's the real name comes from this network is the trade of objects that

022m 30s --> 022m 35s
I'm how to get it there to test it next time um and uh

022m 35s --> 022m 40s
so its hard to understand a program where things can change after the new year

022m 45s --> 022m 50s
design I think people are driven to this because they know the systems are completely

022m 50s --> 022m 55s
intractable without your constant testing other brother question whether

023m 00s --> 023m 05s
this is a test of the bath to try to keep a running a and I think is better

023m 05s --> 023m 10s
what's the weather like you really should have this with me to bility in your program

023m 15s --> 023m 20s
easier to understand if they didn't have it

023m 20s --> 023m 25s
off and then high school is great uh I think

023m 30s --> 023m 35s
tune in providing maybe the friendliest face ever presented to

023m 35s --> 023m 40s
functional programming uh I think that's out there because you in a bit

023m 45s --> 023m 50s
do you realize well you up I'm worrying a lot less than I usually do it

023m 50s --> 023m 55s
restaurants in a I can just bravery go with him to stay to some party

024m 00s --> 024m 05s
what you want to do you want with you so that's the first part of the census reason about

024m 05s --> 024m 10s
but if you put concurrency next there's no doubt about it

024m 15s --> 024m 20s
free WiFi uh but I want you to understand that you don't have to believe me

024m 20s --> 024m 25s
even carried about the solar light just drove so unnecessary

024m 30s --> 024m 35s
#### home for a brother Jonathan you have to read this book

024m 35s --> 024m 40s
uh because the fantastic book as a book that will scare you to death because

024m 45s --> 024m 50s
just so difficult to get right but the other day going to see if you were to resist

024m 50s --> 024m 55s
what is the mention of utilities over and over and over and over and over again

025m 00s --> 025m 05s
42 ugh to do things beautifully in Java

025m 05s --> 025m 10s
you're fighting you know you you're fighting the street you're running a stream drive

025m 15s --> 025m 20s
directions for basically a program to convert the become very much easier

025m 20s --> 025m 25s
everything and you'll see the river circle that's in closure you need something

025m 30s --> 025m 35s
others no doubt about it the new to utilize xr really bad for confirm

025m 35s --> 025m 40s
uh so as the fourth architecture I think

025m 45s --> 025m 50s
we need to for questioning whether or not that's the right way to start I don't care how much is a test

025m 55s --> 026m 00s
about one of the things I came to was you I decided to do the right thing

026m 00s --> 026m 05s
start coding all my job in c-sharp it can be really busy sorry man

026m 10s --> 026m 15s
does static method that took a time return date a functional programming in C

026m 20s --> 026m 25s
and people look like on me like gold of what

026m 30s --> 026m 35s
that and I try to teach young programmers to do that is the second job in the shop

026m 35s --> 026m 40s
better if the functional but functional programming in languages the day before

026m 45s --> 026m 50s
uh so you can do what you want

026m 50s --> 026m 55s
what is matter I think the language that does the right thing served by the falls

027m 00s --> 027m 05s
in space I wanted which was talking to Ala I have to be less

027m 05s --> 027m 10s
for the afternoon Saturday that is closer

027m 15s --> 027m 20s
is happening at the same time that's what it really means a weather

027m 20s --> 027m 25s
happening at the same time to spend a little bit on whether I get more than once if you in what

027m 30s --> 027m 35s
full of simultaneous execution that is mobile trends running on separate

027m 35s --> 027m 40s
if you at the same time often even if you don't have

027m 45s --> 027m 50s
interleave excuse in a little bit this process happens with that

027m 50s --> 027m 55s
send back a forth leaving on a single CPU usage of a multi-threaded program

028m 00s --> 028m 05s
would like to avoid seeing the inconsistent a data

028m 05s --> 028m 10s
are producing inconsistent villa uh

028m 15s --> 028m 20s
the more steps involved in an operation in order for me to program

028m 20s --> 028m 25s
in order to do this I need to take some money out of this account to put over there but check with the

028m 30s --> 028m 35s
you're off work happen or not happened in a program

028m 35s --> 028m 40s
action sport makes it easier but in your programs you have similar kinds of things you need to

028m 45s --> 028m 50s
because of their also affects of concurrency Melissa parallelism

028m 50s --> 028m 55s
live there a parallel programming language is the language is the support of automatic a text

029m 00s --> 029m 05s
send the language speakers out well you know because everything is beautiful I could

029m 05s --> 029m 10s
the Sun with two jobs in 10 minutes 6000 close

029m 15s --> 029m 20s
this is the Sears going to be on the coordination aspects of programs are concurrent

029m 20s --> 029m 25s
the concurrency comes from your uh deciding for excusing

029m 30s --> 029m 35s
purses about were talking about today okay so

029m 35s --> 029m 40s
this is a strong man I'm not talking about closing hear what you have to do today

029m 45s --> 029m 50s
recognition of those those two languages so what do you do now

029m 50s --> 029m 55s
talk about is what do you know if you want to manipulate a collection in your program remote

030m 00s --> 030m 05s
poor thing for eyes inside the block who's that

030m 05s --> 030m 10s
election uh 3 o'clock only one thread can have lockers

030m 15s --> 030m 20s
patient in particular you have to choose to do this write any codes

030m 20s --> 030m 25s
oh I think other people might be using this cyber lock it

030m 30s --> 030m 35s
if the sides do it the convention of course you can say well you can have some

030m 35s --> 030m 40s
prize primitive off in Java on job finally whats the phone

030m 45s --> 030m 50s
directions to visa like I'm checking something with a collection

030m 50s --> 030m 55s
put something in last two steps so sick rise of the two step job lot

031m 00s --> 031m 05s
new clock hopefully uh so what's wrong with

031m 05s --> 031m 10s
what was the problem doing that um what you can't force it right everything

031m 15s --> 031m 20s
is not going to help you decide to stick nothing in dollars

031m 20s --> 031m 25s
autozone forces that's a big problem

031m 30s --> 031m 35s
program know if the size 12

031m 35s --> 031m 40s
this is the worst air inside the locker um that's a big problem

031m 45s --> 031m 50s
this things progress make a decision

031m 50s --> 031m 55s
are you have to go and figure out with a retrofit blocks

032m 00s --> 032m 05s
above that comes from the stomach is CPM machine is locked

032m 05s --> 032m 10s
super powerful global no one's getting here in everybody else that wanted

032m 15s --> 032m 20s
machine and guess what you're running out of the office if you receive this is no longer a maybe someday

032m 20s --> 032m 25s
this is definitely happening on the most mundane Hardware

032m 30s --> 032m 35s
more of that a yes uh

032m 35s --> 032m 40s
another probably the single lockers at it it really is too much uh

032m 45s --> 032m 50s
because you're locking of the readers for rent a writer for messing you up

032m 50s --> 032m 55s
they are also looking at other readers so that's it official

033m 00s --> 033m 05s
end of the solution is a special kind of lock not when you get

033m 05s --> 033m 10s
free by using lock with synchronized the shop in Java but when you man

033m 15s --> 033m 20s
special properties in particular readers the block each other solo careers can be in there

033m 20s --> 033m 25s
eating and they don't like each other so thats it in half of the pros and sport uh

033m 30s --> 033m 35s
by the way for readers in the sub in the strategy

033m 35s --> 033m 40s
but it's better for me parles so that's one solution

033m 45s --> 033m 50s
with everything is covered by collection ever

033m 50s --> 033m 55s
unusual things up but they have a very neat of movies

034m 00s --> 034m 05s
Dennis changed inside implementation a collection account is made of

034m 05s --> 034m 10s
the data in the Thomas Boston for work what the day that I was there

034m 15s --> 034m 20s
that is never going to change this was going to happen is the news to the date is going to get something

034m 20s --> 034m 25s
I also read our lock free even want to read a copyright

034m 30s --> 034m 35s
comic because these are prepare a date over here and then with the time

034m 35s --> 034m 40s
compare and swap operation swap in the data off

034m 45s --> 034m 50s
parents of the lock free operation 11600 process a primitive

034m 50s --> 034m 55s
change of memory value atomically without a thing in between

035m 00s --> 035m 05s
really nice property they were completely lock free uh no blocking in readers

035m 05s --> 035m 10s
no blocking a writer's by readers what love nice things the prom in general

035m 15s --> 035m 20s
surgery the doctor for copyright a real estate of called in love

035m 20s --> 035m 25s
will say if this is more for mostly read situation occasional right

035m 30s --> 035m 35s
petition a multi-step interaction with the copyright

035m 35s --> 035m 40s
historic Weiser lock which makes sense because

035m 45s --> 035m 50s
nothing about the puppies walking is going to help that so

035m 50s --> 035m 55s
what is the population you still have to lock so this is not

036m 00s --> 036m 05s
better job or C sharp today in the solution

036m 05s --> 036m 10s
Toys R Us a collection uh there is

036m 15s --> 036m 20s
42 fern C escola persistent data structure and

036m 20s --> 036m 25s
silly person as well those words that has its thorn Oregon in programming

036m 30s --> 036m 35s
open table to serialize it that's not with the snow services uh

036m 35s --> 036m 40s
we talk about a persistent data structure in functional programming of what we mean

036m 45s --> 036m 50s
what's going to happen is when you want to produce a change birth

036m 50s --> 036m 55s
this truck is going to prison other data structure

037m 00s --> 037m 05s
the recipes for producing new data structures for all the old ones should be you

037m 05s --> 037m 10s
any more uh and that's not true person to person

037m 15s --> 037m 20s
things still find your things fine both can't be changed

037m 20s --> 037m 25s
uh but the truth vs in data structure is for whatever gonna do

037m 30s --> 037m 35s
linear time axis to the middle for vector you have constant or near cost

037m 35s --> 037m 40s
Nexus to anywhere random access right love and if its a real estate

037m 45s --> 037m 50s
double effect on sometimes random lookup spiky a

037m 50s --> 037m 55s
never your performance galaxies are you in the Big O uh

038m 00s --> 038m 05s
really be considered a Pacific collection oh I do like I feel right when I can take a half table

038m 05s --> 038m 10s
make a new have to just settle everything into one by one what was the cost of that off

038m 15s --> 038m 20s
it was expecting when is searching to be constant I'm not linear so

038m 20s --> 038m 25s
assistant data structure a meeting is the performance go to the top reasons

038m 30s --> 038m 35s
the house in 15 uh but the application

038m 35s --> 038m 40s
what is that the new version can see full copy righted

038m 45s --> 038m 50s
I have a feeling your time to copy everything went somehow it came people copy

038m 50s --> 038m 55s
what the #### up you have to touch everything so they have to share structural so you went away

039m 00s --> 039m 05s
immutable collection and I haven't really inexpensive way to make a nuber

039m 05s --> 039m 10s
that was Walton's to it off and is your structure which means they have

039m 15s --> 039m 20s
is really really good and it is really really good stuff

039m 20s --> 039m 25s
if you been programming in list you can probably with a persistent flexible you have a cold

039m 30s --> 039m 35s
on cell why do you the consular functional matter if it persists destruction

039m 35s --> 039m 40s
contact list do you attack the original if I know you got this new list with

039m 45s --> 039m 50s
example of a person this is a very very simple process this structure but it

039m 50s --> 039m 55s
if it does so you serve what's the ball the shade structure

040m 00s --> 040m 05s
oldest one more thing at the front server Chris the definition of Allah

040m 05s --> 040m 10s
search certainly Steve whole heritage of a person list of

040m 15s --> 040m 20s
away I could've written the program written across my career without vectors in Houston

040m 20s --> 040m 25s
way I don't think relaxing code can survive without data circles with those kind of

040m 30s --> 040m 35s
which position a login kind of performance parts are not good enough for the party

040m 35s --> 040m 40s
what I've written for me a lot of people returning functional programming languages are okay with law

040m 45s --> 040m 50s
serving tray by for a list of linear talking about a map

040m 50s --> 040m 55s
use a tree and actors you don't even do it for research

041m 00s --> 041m 05s
assistant district attorney need doctors in and has tables as a lot of time

041m 05s --> 041m 10s
I'll be searching and designing a persistent half mass

041m 15s --> 041m 20s
office closures makes little high performance language with all the functional fitness

041m 20s --> 041m 25s
um in Addison causes a sore tonight and that's the old server classic

041m 30s --> 041m 35s
how do you do a half map 3 day uh

041m 35s --> 041m 40s
with any kind of performance of it is still a tree uh it is a

041m 45s --> 041m 50s
table is this is a tree a into the truth

041m 50s --> 041m 55s
REI high-pressure faktor faktor faktor uh is 30

042m 00s --> 042m 05s
so what you end up with is something that a was originally started by uh

042m 05s --> 042m 10s
the sky Bagwell 0 to pay per view search for array math test

042m 15s --> 042m 20s
uh but his were not functional so what I did was

042m 20s --> 042m 25s
pretty persistent functional version of these data structures but the basic

042m 30s --> 042m 35s
Pass of the value and you masc out ranges in this case

042m 35s --> 042m 40s
I bet ranges 32 a section 328

042m 45s --> 042m 50s
need to distinguish one object from another in a tablespoon

042m 50s --> 042m 55s
first guy in the lease if I did ask if he's the only guy there

043m 00s --> 043m 05s
do you have a collision and you get a new guy who's the same in the first Bible verse eyes

043m 05s --> 043m 10s
playing these look like three mins over here off only then will you use

043m 15s --> 043m 20s
you're only using this much is a half as much stuff as you need to represent the object

043m 20s --> 043m 25s
this is of your being a half table with very very good performance

043m 30s --> 043m 35s
turns its log 32 and a Lago

043m 35s --> 043m 40s
r32 that's a relief all lumber a present this is the map

043m 45s --> 043m 50s
how many levels are talking 7 at the most Elizabeth the first level

043m 50s --> 043m 55s
sons of the side so it's 60 the Titantic data structures

044m 00s --> 044m 05s
uh its three steps if you were at the point something three sets of your

044m 05s --> 044m 10s
login or log what time it doesn't matter that's cause in time to make it smaller

044m 15s --> 044m 20s
time for a meeting with high constant factor there much slower than

044m 20s --> 044m 25s
investigate it further technically cousin time vector solution

044m 30s --> 044m 35s
publication use it as a decent to look up lines are stunningly good

044m 35s --> 044m 40s
as good or better than what comes with a job which is really missing

044m 45s --> 044m 50s
I thought about how do you do the Persistence side

044m 50s --> 044m 55s
trick is to share structure is so what would happen if we took

045m 00s --> 045m 05s
we need a new version of it with wanted to something really change anything

045m 05s --> 045m 10s
well the a grocery store with this the city where is the never

045m 15s --> 045m 20s
in order to do that it needs to copy the path to the new entry in only the test

045m 20s --> 045m 25s
everything else all the staff was appointed the things that are in the oldest

045m 30s --> 045m 35s
is this pill over here in the new one is mostly that but this

045m 35s --> 045m 40s
whiteheads is new just a passing noodles

045m 45s --> 045m 50s
303 use the room

045m 50s --> 045m 55s
you make copies of the stress and that's what all the desk is off

046m 00s --> 046m 05s
used to uh to make manipulating the edge of this um

046m 05s --> 046m 10s
cheap of this data structures use both of the hash tables with

046m 15s --> 046m 20s
vector also work family except there is a partition table

046m 20s --> 046m 25s
Phil's completely uh

046m 30s --> 046m 35s
value that later generally this technique a full structural steel

046m 35s --> 046m 40s
music value and you Sheris much structure with the resort is a good

046m 45s --> 046m 50s
the entire original list is the tale of the new hub

046m 50s --> 046m 55s
that's a pretty simple operations in the principal data structure different state of Texas

047m 00s --> 047m 05s
these two are inserting grow at the end of static resized

047m 05s --> 047m 10s
and the message is a map for map

047m 15s --> 047m 20s
music either this position persistence the last to keep the

047m 20s --> 047m 25s
a performance characteristics there any relationship

047m 30s --> 047m 35s
dollar budget classes where everything is finally sitting inside

047m 35s --> 047m 40s
what is what what utilities to the #### we have and yes there is its own

047m 45s --> 047m 50s
the Ralph final so it is possible to do this is not very

047m 50s --> 047m 55s
very in medical code of but it certainly is school

048m 00s --> 048m 05s
this is Fred safety because the status or chicken never change nothing bad can never have

048m 05s --> 048m 10s
I haven't to threads look at it uh directions

048m 15s --> 048m 20s
is an exception right everything that happened to the other never happened

048m 20s --> 048m 25s
so we looked at an old is a couple of a lot

048m 30s --> 048m 35s
businesses in Ocean Pacific is unfortunately job doesn't come with it

048m 35s --> 048m 40s
best possible job in the close ones are written in Java uh yet

048m 45s --> 048m 50s
problem now everything I talked about before that was the easiest thing to pop

048m 50s --> 048m 55s
we do locus road were talking about only one data structure trying to control

049m 00s --> 049m 05s
thing which we can lock the one thing and do a multiple steps that is big

049m 05s --> 049m 10s
taps in concurrent programming because what happens is in real life

049m 15s --> 049m 20s
text I need to put in this thing only if they're not in this other one right

049m 20s --> 049m 25s
move somebody from this pool that's cool that will make sure the never into pools in Evernote

049m 30s --> 049m 35s
now all the sudden you up to game you need to control more than one

049m 35s --> 049m 40s
data asset in the same like a cooperation uh

049m 45s --> 049m 50s
or C sharp a you have two options really what is

049m 50s --> 049m 55s
whatever Golf Course trailer lock the others finder

050m 00s --> 050m 05s
this lock is locked to use control this set of things

050m 05s --> 050m 10s
really wanted to play anything in the set of things to grab this lock

050m 15s --> 050m 20s
um what's nice about it is the beach multipart operation

050m 20s --> 050m 25s
only requires the factors of 100 NFL

050m 30s --> 050m 35s
ABC over here and the lock for those and if you ever want such a bear city block

050m 35s --> 050m 40s
ABC lock is very safe is the safe

050m 45s --> 050m 50s
what a different set of things like what part of the program

050m 50s --> 050m 55s
use a D&C another part needs to be seen the well is there any BC

051m 00s --> 051m 05s
lock people have to know where at what lock to the need to use for what

051m 05s --> 051m 10s
instructions um this is not good for throughput

051m 15s --> 051m 20s
nystagmus mobile data structures which means it'll be more people interested in these days

051m 25s --> 051m 30s
needless blocking the scenario any others? Of what

051m 30s --> 051m 35s
just reading should I grab a #### I don't know do I do a flying redone

051m 40s --> 051m 45s
because you can occur the cost of holding the world why you read something I want you to remember

051m 45s --> 051m 50s
black ass later wanna hold the world hours really

051m 55s --> 052m 00s
so what is a lot to do searches in self

052m 00s --> 052m 05s
call the one to participate in our operation so now you say if I will

052m 10s --> 052m 15s
the look it up and see in the movies do whatever I need to do

052m 15s --> 052m 20s
and any logical operation may require multiple locks

052m 25s --> 052m 30s
uh because most programs start

052m 35s --> 052m 40s
Passat program so we can look at this new stuff or have other

052m 45s --> 052m 50s
and then uh I need a back rub to generate reports and you're like up

052m 50s --> 052m 55s
now all the stuff it was written notice but would ever be seen from other one

053m 00s --> 053m 05s
who is the best laid plan is still extremely difficult to write to you later plans

053m 05s --> 053m 10s
do that and then what happens all program things change Newark

053m 15s --> 053m 20s
sure you count for everything is streaming hard as I thought I was going to say it

053m 20s --> 053m 25s
it's almost impossible I sit and help people working for

053m 30s --> 053m 35s
contractions all day long it's extremely difficult

053m 35s --> 053m 40s
you know the basic problems with this evening before we get into the strategies which isn't surprising

053m 45s --> 053m 50s
and why was a lot of DNA you have a problem

053m 50s --> 053m 55s
the recipe for deadlock right we actually get a while get big

054m 00s --> 054m 05s
um its very possible this is very difficult on 4th locking doors

054m 05s --> 054m 10s
FF conventional #### alphabetically of like a real number the Pandora

054m 15s --> 054m 20s
it's the term in a stick and mechanical hard to do

054m 20s --> 054m 25s
on the other hand if you can do this correctly it would be better for putting the global catalog

054m 30s --> 054m 35s
uh the same question though

054m 35s --> 054m 40s
to get very random results of you though

054m 45s --> 054m 50s
what you have to do today if you're looking very special and I don't know

054m 50s --> 054m 55s
special for job at the shop in the morning special language or something does it for you

055m 00s --> 055m 05s
beautiful after forever but the structural aspect is a program written with me the logic

055m 05s --> 055m 10s
that is the program is composed of direct references

055m 15s --> 055m 20s
references direct references the things I can save as soon as you've done that

055m 20s --> 055m 25s
truly you are stuck with this locking stuff there's nothing else you can do

055m 30s --> 055m 35s
is this better batter is manual 24

055m 35s --> 055m 40s
and everythings convention every application of the side locking it before be lucky enough

055m 45s --> 055m 50s
it's not in the programming languages on napkins or is a doc somewhere whatever

055m 50s --> 055m 55s
some guys head off but it is not in your program unfortunately

056m 00s --> 056m 05s
closest does a stupid persistent instructions for to talk about

056m 05s --> 056m 10s
and we have the knowledge visibility programs in which you need to

056m 15s --> 056m 20s
what we're going to do is going to have a a reference to something

056m 20s --> 056m 25s
reference around I'll be stable reference um but what refers to that can change

056m 30s --> 056m 35s
is it the cell that holds appointment with a cell will always be able to track of

056m 35s --> 056m 40s
the point is the thing that may change the cell can you take it to the Titanic sink

056m 45s --> 056m 50s
the difference in closer if you have indirect reference is the things I could never

056m 50s --> 056m 55s
age but those references to be made to refer to other things

057m 00s --> 057m 05s
remember Fred looking Fredette one for the program in with the new

057m 05s --> 057m 10s
I think I can look for another party will be something else this going to cheat the same

057m 15s --> 057m 20s
another point for first that same feel a look at Fred

057m 20s --> 057m 25s
different from a shin the difference is this is indirect

057m 30s --> 057m 35s
that I thought I hold onto um NFL's references to change

057m 35s --> 057m 40s
the park closer that's beautiful the first thing so far talked about in class

057m 45s --> 057m 50s
tuxes list vectors map set none of that can change the oil

057m 50s --> 057m 55s
what is reference type uh and was important about the

058m 00s --> 058m 05s
just like pulling the functions to make a point to different things

058m 05s --> 058m 10s
those functions have sex with I'll talk about in a minute

058m 15s --> 058m 20s
other things not mess that up Anderson force for the 70's reference

058m 20s --> 058m 25s
can we change the transaction guess what

058m 30s --> 058m 35s
convention is all manual to change f1 do you in the other things never change

058m 35s --> 058m 40s
what if you actually the record for this reference is your getting you a lot

058m 45s --> 058m 50s
no this will never change what you looking at that's really beautiful

058m 50s --> 058m 55s
uh and in the application programs are NOLA NOLA

059m 00s --> 059m 05s
so I said this is the generic Lee call references

059m 05s --> 059m 10s
kind of a little off re use the word pencil see one of the reference Texas

059m 15s --> 059m 20s
so the references of the only thing the closer the better closer than you can you stop in closer

059m 20s --> 059m 25s
all kinds of things that can change the job I don't protect you from

059m 30s --> 059m 35s
um but in closer ollies references can change it really do take

059m 35s --> 059m 40s
this is inspired by ml ml is a pickle a reference in is really neat idea

059m 45s --> 059m 50s
array6 I will talk about the references a kind of neat idea problem for me in

059m 50s --> 059m 55s
talking at the close was it has no control animals free from cell

060m 00s --> 060m 05s
positive truck is it easy way to one data structure interchange version of

060m 05s --> 060m 10s
you really needed surgery. can put a lil bit I could you make a list of the changes to

060m 15s --> 060m 20s
is referred changed person so there are three types

060m 20s --> 060m 25s
of these references in closer of those things called bars

060m 30s --> 060m 35s
global variables and functions of the global Ocean Boulevard

060m 35s --> 060m 40s
in addition bars have the ability to be bound to see

060m 45s --> 060m 50s
binding is independent of other thread so I can find a bar called x2 about you

060m 50s --> 060m 55s
this thread I can buy to differ by you not read Anne says chemical a text

061m 00s --> 061m 05s
rolls like a stack of a little bit more but the permissive ours

061m 05s --> 061m 10s
is at bars for isolating changes within to read the thread what is the only 1i

061m 15s --> 061m 20s
program another thing you need to do in programs is the big is the moon

061m 20s --> 061m 25s
complex case it's the I need to move the service account for that account

061m 30s --> 061m 35s
I need to change two things I need to make a whole change a comic

061m 35s --> 061m 40s
and for that you need a trans axle for the rest in closer

061m 45s --> 061m 50s
value is sharing them synchronously and you sure

061m 50s --> 061m 55s
Courtney changes wrestle a change more than one thing in a coordinated

062m 00s --> 062m 05s
is the Superbowl the hiding the changes in dreads ref make

062m 05s --> 062m 10s
receiver Mobile friends ended it does a transaction again

062m 15s --> 062m 20s
publicly the third thing you might want to do is you might want to have a

062m 20s --> 062m 25s
change a single to sleep and independently but the beat festival for multiple threads

062m 30s --> 062m 35s
support that so with an Asian you have something that can change of

062m 35s --> 062m 40s
you can make a request for to change and it will eventually do that it'll do that iPhone 5

062m 45s --> 062m 50s
the whole different flavor things and uses for different purposes

062m 50s --> 062m 55s
I've written off as agent address is a suit

063m 00s --> 063m 05s
place in a composite let's break down

063m 05s --> 063m 10s
uh I'm not going to talk but all about

063m 15s --> 063m 20s
vessel variables in common with access to have thread semantics Collison

063m 20s --> 063m 25s
how many presidents are some particular color list two of the closest dog

063m 30s --> 063m 35s
of boys have a stack of the plane so if you find something in a bind again

063m 35s --> 063m 40s
invite again as a stack of ones those bindings on one and eventually gets restore

063m 45s --> 063m 50s
contact kind of programming you can set bars but very physically

063m 50s --> 063m 55s
what is Simon Says the next to be 5 of the only the treadmill clean

064m 00s --> 064m 05s
very cool I can talk for 2 hours about them

064m 05s --> 064m 10s
Reston transactions on the most about so how does this work

064m 15s --> 064m 20s
what happened to publicly that smells a lot like a database transaction in fact it is

064m 20s --> 064m 25s
transactions system Mr use inside your program of a transaxle

064m 30s --> 064m 35s
uh and I've used the term for the people who makes a virgin

064m 35s --> 064m 40s
remember what time it closes is very application-level

064m 45s --> 064m 50s
entries of yourself who is resting about references to

064m 50s --> 064m 55s
and the system for allowing changes what happens

065m 00s --> 065m 05s
when you make a change the transaction at James is the atomic and isolated

065m 05s --> 065m 10s
hey sailor asses off of Davis what can City Kansas

065m 15s --> 065m 20s
its atomic a nice little Ricci's it

065m 20s --> 065m 25s
everything is you make tour to set a breath inside a transaction I don't happen

065m 30s --> 065m 35s
everyone says I think this is David the other thing is a better

065m 35s --> 065m 40s
isolated so why you're talking about in your transaction you don't see

065m 45s --> 065m 50s
a big difference with transactions in Sulphur transaction number is this the least once

065m 50s --> 065m 55s
most of the road this way that is the transactions a speculative and they're all a map

066m 00s --> 066m 05s
B&N we both getting the new with like you get there first

066m 05s --> 066m 10s
I don't get a failure my trans axle automatically retry

066m 15s --> 066m 20s
part of the transactions for refried the database a mostly by law

066m 20s --> 066m 25s
walkie with Ville now sometimes you getting there starting your work

066m 30s --> 066m 35s
um it'll be on a Mac to be tried a key thing about that is there for you

066m 35s --> 066m 40s
can I have any side effects of it as you make a job a call it says press

066m 45s --> 066m 50s
Pine Hill I've been sick so no side effects allowed in transactions

066m 50s --> 066m 55s
you have

067m 00s --> 067m 05s
what what does that happen is that you going to be looking at the new transactions

067m 05s --> 067m 10s
when you retry the situation that said your go is not sure anymore

067m 15s --> 067m 20s
did my job if you can so that's how it works

067m 20s --> 067m 25s
uh have to live like an elf notion but I really feel it

067m 30s --> 067m 35s
so alone

067m 35s --> 067m 40s
details about the SM closure is its very neat

067m 45s --> 067m 50s
you wrap your code with fixing the sink

067m 50s --> 067m 55s
and anything that you do inside that is a transaction that includes a call you make a call

068m 00s --> 068m 05s
if it is absorbed by the the power transaction Cielo happen or not nothing

068m 05s --> 068m 10s
SMS it use say to say and you

068m 15s --> 068m 20s
its its magic uh

068m 20s --> 068m 25s
but it's really really complicated I ate closures LSU this is

068m 30s --> 068m 35s
is the Oracle or PostgreSQL those are dead

068m 35s --> 068m 40s
what is motivation concurrency control the idea behind

068m 45s --> 068m 50s
that is you keep old versions of the date around to support lingering read

068m 50s --> 068m 55s
the writer's can continue to produce new data readers will see service not so the world

069m 00s --> 069m 05s
which means if I start a transaction all the reasons

069m 05s --> 069m 10s
do inside the transaction appear to have happened at the same point in time

069m 15s --> 069m 20s
add appointment I might raise after the card and I will only see value the reference

069m 20s --> 069m 25s
map point I'm or things that I've myself a change my transaction no other values

069m 30s --> 069m 35s
when I commit those changes with Pierre to happen for everybody else

069m 35s --> 069m 40s
active as if it happens if we at the same point I'm so nothing is spread out over time

069m 45s --> 069m 50s
the from a consumer sale point is you always the consistency of the entire world

069m 50s --> 069m 55s
every reference you C inside a transaction weather reader or writer

070m 00s --> 070m 05s
block writers or other readers they never blossom so

070m 05s --> 070m 10s
does a great amount of throughput that's why does contain Percy and writers

070m 15s --> 070m 20s
if you reading plan 10 and they produced 11 12 13 you don't care as long

070m 20s --> 070m 25s
assistant in continues living 10 you'll see the world as of 10

070m 30s --> 070m 35s
is the use of those the right thing

070m 35s --> 070m 40s
oh yeah and the other thing is the closest in the sports

070m 45s --> 070m 50s
time to change you need to make our a community like

070m 50s --> 070m 55s
ok a, the counter or at a value to them as a result the transaction well

071m 00s --> 071m 05s
right back at you been writing transaction for something

071m 05s --> 071m 10s
which means no different but if I'm getting something from the feeling you're going

071m 15s --> 071m 20s
I had something I could use a few good at it if I had to read modify

071m 20s --> 071m 25s
set it and you have to read my face it we couldn't cooperate with us or operation the communitive

071m 30s --> 071m 35s
does add one to the water bill seasons doesn't matter and so on

071m 35s --> 071m 40s
close restaurants supports can you to the proper operation

071m 45s --> 071m 50s
is managed independent state the idea who is that does pizza State

071m 50s --> 071m 55s
indigenous responsible for it you can get us the to change by sending

072m 00s --> 072m 05s
whatever your state is applied to it and that's your new state the trick is

072m 05s --> 072m 10s
uh you send actions to Asian music Portugal send or

072m 15s --> 072m 20s
is that request for the change its cute up in that agent and eventually

072m 20s --> 072m 25s
ASIC wrestling in a fragile that actually happened this is from

072m 30s --> 072m 35s
networkers I have a very high degree of Independence the nice thing about it is

072m 35s --> 072m 40s
questions and they meet Li continue the work the change happens eventually

072m 45s --> 072m 50s
under the hood make sure that no more than one action is happening per agent at a time

072m 50s --> 072m 55s
all the activities on an agent or serialized system that would be the hard part

073m 00s --> 073m 05s
working you know what happens if you safe from the single source do this do that

073m 05s --> 073m 10s
other this that and the other will happen in water

073m 15s --> 073m 20s
LA but is that the state is always available if I wanna go see what to say to the Skype

073m 20s --> 073m 25s
it may not be all the

073m 30s --> 073m 35s
um but if extremely convenient vs a systems where you have to make

073m 35s --> 073m 40s
request for change and then make a request off for me send you a message back

073m 45s --> 073m 50s
there are lots of other cool features agents in particular sometimes you like to make sure

073m 50s --> 073m 55s
the work you asked for it on the way to do that using a weight

074m 00s --> 074m 05s
basic a separate with you you unblock like they do this that and the other thing

074m 05s --> 074m 10s
awake now I will wait for you do the same

074m 15s --> 074m 20s
action send other actions agency have anything to be able to do those things happen

074m 20s --> 074m 25s
does a dissatisfied have it sent after the agency The Sims

074m 30s --> 074m 35s
go to the next step that happens in order if you want

074m 35s --> 074m 40s
you can I see right in that order but the transactions the

074m 45s --> 074m 50s
transaction they are way to achieve once on the side effects

074m 50s --> 074m 55s
because what happens if you dispatch uh an action inside a train

075m 00s --> 075m 05s
so you know this is actually get retried you think you're sending this message over and over you really

075m 05s --> 075m 10s
you only ever get someone so if you want to Tysons by the fact that you could

075m 15s --> 075m 20s
write in a meeting with lock in transactions a problem

075m 20s --> 075m 25s
action trying to get your work done and get out

075m 30s --> 075m 35s
sons of you need closure threads do that you can do the closest

075m 35s --> 075m 40s
Fred you can dispatch of operations with executives from work

075m 45s --> 075m 50s
directions on of food you I try to swing arm is on

075m 50s --> 075m 55s
for the store um but I would prefer prefer the

076m 00s --> 076m 05s
the same purpose but the raid the fridge from for the earlier

076m 05s --> 076m 10s
alright who who

076m 15s --> 076m 20s
I wrote a broken

076m 20s --> 076m 25s
assimilation of an ant colony

076m 30s --> 076m 35s
uh but I guess you could use it if you didn't know something about it

076m 35s --> 076m 40s
experiment with what would be a good thing uh

076m 45s --> 076m 50s
an answer no one around trying to find food brand

076m 50s --> 076m 55s
back home does a good place in the world with his home along the way to go drop

077m 00s --> 077m 05s
as for food show me to make a decision

077m 05s --> 077m 10s
about how to leverage that information

077m 15s --> 077m 20s
well we have to present the perfect in system friends and fake

077m 20s --> 077m 25s
friends are over because people to have a smoke a city boxes

077m 30s --> 077m 35s
I'm not saying this to be necessary if you have the stuff to do most people just read it

077m 35s --> 077m 40s
big loop right tell if a chance baby baby baby baby hey Bandera

077m 45s --> 077m 50s
what is an example of a system that would require a lot of coordination

077m 50s --> 077m 55s
what mobile thread is a good example of what's hard about the car park

078m 00s --> 078m 05s
complex uh we're going to throw in we want to model for

078m 05s --> 078m 10s
operation because it's hard on and it probably is

078m 15s --> 078m 20s
turns all green I need to talk about pray about it but the idea is that yo buy back

078m 20s --> 078m 25s
only the valuable password be repaired uh we should have it

078m 30s --> 078m 35s
closer um n end up being really tiny

078m 35s --> 078m 40s
pretty simple uh

078m 45s --> 078m 50s
uh alright so what we have here

078m 50s --> 078m 55s
is the some closure source code

079m 00s --> 079m 05s
email you'll note my complete ineptitude at the max

079m 05s --> 079m 10s
I never learned it before I head closer uh why when I pregnant

079m 15s --> 079m 20s
but I am really lucky that somebody is written a nice clothes remote for the Mac lab

079m 20s --> 079m 25s
send text I lighting bunch of other neat features only a fraction

079m 30s --> 079m 35s
in the bottom we have a raffle for closer

079m 35s --> 079m 40s
I'm already

079m 45s --> 079m 50s
if its a problem uh because I want to try to get by

079m 50s --> 079m 55s
scream at one time already talked to the living room for my relationship

080m 00s --> 080m 05s
closer what is a list that means that a

080m 05s --> 080m 10s
operations are in parentheses write an operator is first

080m 15s --> 080m 20s
open whats the same number friend of the closest you'll go

080m 20s --> 080m 25s
as I said literal does a vector uh

080m 30s --> 080m 35s
thank you buy your kids I babysit Prince of commas color white space

080m 35s --> 080m 40s
vitamin if I was there but they don't do anything uh

080m 50s --> 080m 55s
is that a map now in the operator position and I can look up a

081m 00s --> 081m 05s
couple a quick a uh things easier to show

081m 05s --> 081m 10s
immutability what sold

081m 15s --> 081m 20s
map of the water cycle test

081m 20s --> 081m 25s
uh and other functions associate with the store for associate what River

081m 30s --> 081m 35s
all of this record a fab

081m 35s --> 081m 40s
for

081m 45s --> 081m 50s
hey question ah

081m 50s --> 081m 55s
yes you want to get cozy here

082m 00s --> 082m 05s
yes

082m 30s --> 082m 35s
uh oh so you so well

082m 45s --> 082m 50s
person uh and then

082m 50s --> 082m 55s
if I were to uh well I say the same thing

083m 00s --> 083m 05s
CA 42

083m 05s --> 083m 10s
Bush's what changes a map associate this map

083m 15s --> 083m 20s
who won the fight this feels to mass

083m 20s --> 083m 25s
100000 and what causes you

083m 30s --> 083m 35s
and also if things were you tested for buffets to Facebook

083m 35s --> 083m 40s
the reason I have to do something about this for both purposes uh

083m 45s --> 083m 50s
who has the best worst thing as we go through uh

083m 50s --> 083m 55s
it would be it would be great if you could get a sense although I guess everybody here

084m 00s --> 084m 05s
it was totally cool to do this program because I said both of my day to go put my represent

084m 05s --> 084m 10s
find some stuff that I need to see it like for the Galleria

084m 15s --> 084m 20s
everyone with a better chance program really love it um so it

084m 20s --> 084m 25s
fun to bring that it's records on experience is the job of world

084m 30s --> 084m 35s
best wide uh 60 tracking number man says the square

084m 35s --> 084m 40s
Number bed what's the fix something later is there before 9 a.m.

084m 45s --> 084m 50s
the range of Mount of food place daily values for the

084m 50s --> 084m 55s
drawing the rent for a month and food and evaporation rate

085m 00s --> 085m 05s
access your time for how long does sleep in the animation Lupton

085m 05s --> 085m 10s
and behavior in about a racing

085m 15s --> 085m 20s
again if you no califica like I'm so far

085m 20s --> 085m 25s
uh we have the truck fell and older

085m 30s --> 085m 35s
say we should just go look like

085m 35s --> 085m 40s
truck I'm sending these guys for the bottom the evaluator

085m 45s --> 085m 50s
only furniture so now I have a definition of the cell

085m 50s --> 085m 55s
what you have the truck you can you create one but thanks

086m 00s --> 086m 05s
that was supplied to the destructors saw this for real what

086m 05s --> 086m 10s
look like map stocks a map

086m 15s --> 086m 20s
have a baby by 80 6400 Google have

086m 20s --> 086m 25s
food TNF Bourque republikein ok

086m 30s --> 086m 35s
princes of the map will sell those keys that's really awesome

086m 35s --> 086m 40s
but in every way structure map is it a killer um

086m 45s --> 086m 50s
what could an element

086m 50s --> 086m 55s
okay

087m 00s --> 087m 05s
account of food counter for Mon I'm having Thomas

087m 05s --> 087m 10s
they may also have an insult send mail to be does me to go home

087m 15s --> 087m 20s
free say every so how's that for some ridiculous you don't need to

087m 20s --> 087m 25s
The Avenue at the house in doesn't uh okay

087m 30s --> 087m 35s
there are actually two the vectors and closes early vector the better

087m 35s --> 087m 40s
resurrection job for this is a furlough function inside we can look at it we're going to me

087m 45s --> 087m 50s
about to create a struct sell object

087m 50s --> 087m 55s
with no food and no firma 00 and dinner

088m 00s --> 088m 05s
references wrestling talked about earlier that something that can only be changed the transaction

088m 05s --> 088m 10s
the rear end up with 6400 references

088m 15s --> 088m 20s
map the

088m 20s --> 088m 25s
closer that's correct this is not a verb right there a map

088m 30s --> 088m 35s
uh make a spoon and I have a world

088m 35s --> 088m 40s
the world is there a

088m 45s --> 088m 50s
always the reference that way so I'm going to help a functional place and I will

088m 50s --> 088m 55s
find a spot in the world to go to self

089m 00s --> 089m 05s
because it's not that simple what is a bike

089m 05s --> 089m 10s
this is an organ lesson inside that is a factor but this is an example destroy

089m 15s --> 089m 20s
I writing the a binding as a vector it can name the

089m 20s --> 089m 25s
is inside the doctor directly I supposed to say I think of actor kal V and then inside

089m 30s --> 089m 35s
structuring I can just record say I think about the other than the first thing a wife

089m 35s --> 089m 40s
place to find a function we can try it what's the place

089m 45s --> 089m 50s
um I don't usually care about the rest I might want to see what's inside them

089m 50s --> 089m 55s
and we can do that like a lady rough for those a reader macro

090m 00s --> 090m 05s
the place I see well that's good everything good so far

090m 05s --> 090m 10s
uh I now have something

090m 15s --> 090m 20s
north and then it clockwise 280 square world

090m 20s --> 090m 25s
restaurants uh

090m 30s --> 090m 35s
does that and that will love pizza but that's awful

090m 35s --> 090m 40s
now we can trade in another hear the first instance where

090m 45s --> 090m 50s
answer going to live in the world and that's really rather date

090m 50s --> 090m 55s
for creating it mean uh placing an inch

091m 00s --> 091m 05s
get to things when is where to go in the world and the others which direction

091m 05s --> 091m 10s
the facing Ali and the now you see

091m 15s --> 091m 20s
change references in transactions will think a is the primitive

091m 20s --> 091m 25s
that start a transaction for anything with inside the Friends of the sink is going to be in

091m 30s --> 091m 35s
I got rid of the macro that here I got tired of rice

091m 35s --> 091m 40s
Milford Rd sick and I said I'll be parked closer uh

091m 45s --> 091m 50s
location: I just call place before right there is a reference to the place

091m 50s --> 091m 55s
okay Elena Kristen and instruct him

092m 00s --> 092m 05s
call alter alters on the way you can change a reference

092m 05s --> 092m 10s
set Walter and commute alters kind of the night

092m 15s --> 092m 20s
function with you Lord for all for me for this is alter

092m 20s --> 092m 25s
the thing at p which way does a little map right associating

092m 30s --> 092m 35s
no that doesn't change the data structure that was that right so what is a social

092m 35s --> 092m 40s
Prison new map doesn't change the map of Fair

092m 45s --> 092m 50s
where does Anthony don't change the message was that you're going to get to watch

092m 50s --> 092m 55s
so no mas never change no data structure the closer every

093m 00s --> 093m 05s
with the sociation with the fam just like a so-so to 4

093m 05s --> 093m 10s
I'm listening to create a new map taking what was in pain

093m 15s --> 093m 20s
call the function of the state of the things you say what's up after the reference

093m 20s --> 093m 25s
uh I never got a return of an agent

093m 30s --> 093m 35s
tax locations for the idea here the world is a set of references

093m 35s --> 093m 40s
who sells of the cells have food for months baby have

093m 45s --> 093m 50s
in a transaction then we're going to have agents in Egypt Prince

093m 50s --> 093m 55s
a synchronous guys are going to do work there state is going to be location

094m 00s --> 094m 05s
note 2 o'clock place a face that I would be potentially

094m 05s --> 094m 10s
art thing to maintain a few words right this manually with lock everything like that just make sure note

094m 15s --> 094m 20s
in charge of making sure that that's the case so we're going to take a location where Paso

094m 20s --> 094m 25s
we create an app uh

094m 30s --> 094m 35s
0 of insurrection 0 uh

094m 35s --> 094m 40s
credit

094m 45s --> 094m 50s
flight here hey American CA is

094m 50s --> 094m 55s
it's just an agent agent give me the rest like references

095m 00s --> 095m 05s
place 00 what do we say

095m 05s --> 095m 10s
nm cool

095m 15s --> 095m 20s
how to move a little more clear so up

095m 20s --> 095m 25s
all set for where home is in range that's why I have an square root now because

095m 30s --> 095m 35s
is this all there for a confidence builder square root

095m 35s --> 095m 40s
free life Square big enough to hold me in huh

095m 45s --> 095m 50s
the sequence of an agent okay so if we're placing

095m 50s --> 095m 55s
definitely the world are we better be in a transaction

096m 00s --> 096m 05s
right we're going to uh uh go through

096m 05s --> 096m 10s
free food place we're going to find a place Brooke pick a random places to go

096m 15s --> 096m 20s
better food in the range of food before the whole turkey same things up before

096m 20s --> 096m 25s
funny this is this the transaction does Will Smith Midway a lot

096m 30s --> 096m 35s
this is the this is the list

096m 35s --> 096m 40s
call for those for Ajax in this sequence whatever it is and he's wine

096m 45s --> 096m 50s
what's the confession cover for tax reasons those were going to do some work

096m 50s --> 096m 55s
I'm the real a job of 4 return

097m 00s --> 097m 05s
everything that's because Chris is axis side effects of service which is tomorrow

097m 05s --> 097m 10s
place a couple do all the talking all the place we're going to say this is the home

097m 15s --> 097m 20s
call then start at home a little square to put Elizabeth Way

097m 20s --> 097m 25s
okay in a transaction from home is it a sin

097m 30s --> 097m 35s
will the world is a Taurus to connect the at the side

097m 35s --> 097m 40s
around three other effect pop a bottle return to the game

097m 45s --> 097m 50s
the bottom has a friend um so between

097m 50s --> 097m 55s
the donut world have to go from one to the other end in the direction world

098m 00s --> 098m 05s
I rather uh

098m 05s --> 098m 10s
the W ran

098m 15s --> 098m 20s
simulation for you need to remember you need to make a menace election and then

098m 20s --> 098m 25s
picking from have different probabilities you pretend you have a roulette wheel

098m 30s --> 098m 35s
finger slice is a bigger just look at the floor

098m 35s --> 098m 40s
does that in the back of life size is the returns in the life getting around

098m 45s --> 098m 50s
so we should try this one and no idea but it takes one with a tobacco

098m 50s --> 098m 55s
of Boca 7234 um this is going to return

099m 00s --> 099m 05s
more often Pacifica probabilities no fighting just a really hard

099m 05s --> 099m 10s
free right

099m 15s --> 099m 20s
what would ex wife of the day what's the function is one

099m 20s --> 099m 25s
how do the final in the fun the phone

099m 30s --> 099m 35s
what do you think about mass map of Russia the keys

099m 35s --> 099m 40s
doesn't need the number

099m 45s --> 099m 50s
Bella salon

099m 50s --> 099m 55s
that's a really cool to be able to go to my profile what's what's up

100m 00s --> 100m 05s
what the #### is that works then I got tired of reading

100m 05s --> 100m 10s
will so I roll a macro little sick though I called you sick from now on on you

100m 15s --> 100m 20s
we have a bunch of small behaviors a house over time do I need to

100m 20s --> 100m 25s
rap the song is over okay where to pick up the room

100m 30s --> 100m 35s
I so tired president application at this point

100m 35s --> 100m 40s
the world so they're all gonna be transactional so turns it take a location in the Mount

100m 45s --> 100m 50s
uh any particular dysfunction turn move whatever is the function of

100m 50s --> 100m 55s
in inches when was city state of an indigenous

101m 00s --> 101m 05s
please see these are all functions of at least the location of other day about all the functions about the app

101m 05s --> 101m 10s
location: causes a function to go to become actions of the SAT

101m 15s --> 101m 20s
Lisa function of a state to see about an axis

101m 20s --> 101m 25s
are actually in agent function so difficult

101m 30s --> 101m 35s
that's there what is the speed data now doing all the place a SoC

101m 35s --> 101m 40s
a man with the results of altering the end by teasing 3

101m 45s --> 101m 50s
anything really to do with the new cell

101m 50s --> 101m 55s
that new and put that new cell in that old place we can really change

102m 00s --> 102m 05s
this is all really worthwhile hopefully

102m 05s --> 102m 10s
but its not that hard even if it wasn't worth I don't think

102m 15s --> 102m 20s
this thing doesn't change location but remember up in action is the function of the

102m 20s --> 102m 25s
play to the bank so it better take a look at something in return location

102m 30s --> 102m 35s
okay now move removing is the directions heading

102m 40s --> 102m 45s
in the way I know see this function itself

102m 45s --> 102m 50s
doesn't have thinking it and if you were to call if it would

102m 55s --> 103m 00s
the transaction is a ping an official to constantly recheck for the presence of the

103m 00s --> 103m 05s
inside moves so the decision making process of the behavior to find them

103m 10s --> 103m 15s
pirate Texas no answer the way nothin forcing a note with his face

103m 15s --> 103m 20s
work we get the work of old P worry we were removed from this place

103m 25s --> 103m 30s
delta function at the figures out the new location

103m 30s --> 103m 35s
Bakery Cafe

103m 40s --> 103m 45s
the new locations 4223 from where you are pointing the directions

103m 45s --> 103m 50s
and I we find a place there's nothing to be our photographer

103m 55s --> 104m 00s
call to the old place in this social cyst removed the ski

104m 00s --> 104m 05s
nor am I lol uh and then

104m 10s --> 104m 15s
so we don't talk for a little bit otherwise when we move we leave for a month behind

104m 15s --> 104m 20s
okay so this is says if the place where we were is it home

104m 25s --> 104m 30s
the lot of work in a couple places altar of this

104m 30s --> 104m 35s
is a hard job with lock lock what is a what order do you like

104m 40s --> 104m 45s
very easy well here I am saying how's the weather this function doesn't even do that

104m 45s --> 104m 50s
ringdroid

104m 55s --> 105m 00s
because the transaction I figured out the food there is more than zero food

105m 05s --> 105m 10s
decorating with food and give the food put that in about

105m 15s --> 105m 20s
isn't it this is changing to attribute of the mass building new map

105m 20s --> 105m 25s
going to return the same location oh yeah notebook movie return the new

105m 30s --> 105m 35s
that's one of the few that are the different value here to take food does a movie you

105m 35s --> 105m 40s
uh like that drop food same story

105m 45s --> 105m 50s
you are same kind of thing if it went through to the place where you are

105m 50s --> 105m 55s
disassociate for from you NFL for now

106m 00s --> 106m 05s
I need a helper functions arrange things by some sorting function so I don't want to

106m 05s --> 106m 10s
I want their ranks uh so what is it

106m 15s --> 106m 20s
a map of them to there was a stray when you sort them by their key function

106m 20s --> 106m 25s
so I can have a bunch of things to buy some function and then return a map of the thing

106m 30s --> 106m 35s
its not that interesting um uh

106m 35s --> 106m 40s
its called her do some other hobby haven

106m 45s --> 106m 50s
over and over and over again it is in the head so what

106m 50s --> 106m 55s
final offer places where are we what's the answer to the Play Store app

107m 00s --> 107m 05s
and we're going to make a list of places that are in front of us kinda

107m 05s --> 107m 10s
head head slightly to the left to the right we're going to use the way

107m 15s --> 107m 20s
supple lips of them name that you need uh

107m 20s --> 107m 25s
star transaction I'm going to know what is next to life free live for the moment

107m 30s --> 107m 35s
trying to get home or charging so we're going to say if

107m 35s --> 107m 40s
food I'm closer has a common law

107m 45s --> 107m 50s
the $40 means fault anything else true

107m 50s --> 107m 55s
um so I don't care about the value of food in the oven just got up

108m 00s --> 108m 05s
the conditions here what is I am home right at this place is Marcus ahlm

108m 05s --> 108m 10s
a map so the answer is going to drop the food off I gotta clean this

108m 15s --> 108m 20s
basically is like a reading things to say take my location

108m 20s --> 108m 25s
important to the first function of this is a wrap it going to make a function of a call

108m 30s --> 108m 35s
turn that would be the value of the first argument turn

108m 35s --> 108m 40s
text this a drop it off location in turn off that for

108m 45s --> 108m 50s
um so is the function of location

108m 50s --> 108m 55s
location: then turn that thing by for the location

109m 00s --> 109m 05s
if we see this is home in front of us and no answer there we call me

109m 05s --> 109m 10s
remember was a requirement move that would be in a transaction which we are and we know that there's no

109m 15s --> 109m 20s
these functions cooperate new for the birth of biotic Lee otherwise

109m 20s --> 109m 25s
weather stripping for now we have to do some sort of selection and uh this is probably

109m 30s --> 109m 35s
I need to rank of the possibilities 3 possibly moving forward

109m 35s --> 109m 40s
turning left or to the right of the three things I can do

109m 45s --> 109m 50s
this is to it what is in a wreck by his home in front of us that's worth

109m 50s --> 109m 55s
um and this is a bunch of little

110m 00s --> 110m 05s
so have a safe fun something and then write this

110m 05s --> 110m 10s
something here I can say sharp the body and a sister said

110m 15s --> 110m 20s
60 Plato and I was closer this is the same as fun of app

110m 20s --> 110m 25s
if home X 10

110m 30s --> 110m 35s
don't bother with this right fun so hard uh

110m 35s --> 110m 40s
tell work you're composing that little #### with the rest of anything

110m 45s --> 110m 50s
the place is sorted by their phone contacts that were mercenaries 2 map

110m 50s --> 110m 55s
with plus to take a minor beach Key with plus

111m 00s --> 111m 05s
the right now three choices um then we're going to head

111m 05s --> 111m 10s
call a doctor and like master functions of the keys vectors of

111m 15s --> 111m 20s
when I move what would turn left or right circle three functions

111m 20s --> 111m 25s
factor that we make a random electroid right of those racks

111m 30s --> 111m 35s
on off the location this is probably just too

111m 35s --> 111m 40s
viber as I said that in a more steps but that's what's happening I'm taking a

111m 45s --> 111m 50s
will think based upon the ranks I calculator before that is the function

111m 50s --> 111m 55s
express enough of them colocation am I going to move from left to right

112m 00s --> 112m 05s
I found food where I am and I'm not home back out of your home

112m 05s --> 112m 10s
right so if I found food I'm not home gonna take the food and forever

112m 15s --> 112m 20s
that's also not home and no answer I remember those caviar then I can move

112m 20s --> 112m 25s
I'll go there another person text cycle I'll take out food

112m 30s --> 112m 35s
I take it you're not allowed to write the rain

112m 35s --> 112m 40s
the front of me by the food causes and the firm I'm looking for food

112m 45s --> 112m 50s
yes or up love behave Las Vegas

112m 50s --> 112m 55s
ocean in there enough for me Luke off huh

113m 00s --> 113m 05s
whatever but fresh for months or more valuable really old 111 McKinley definitely

113m 05s --> 113m 10s
that useful and theoretically in my very limited and knowledge

113m 15s --> 113m 20s
map reading up a big job to make the perfect couple

113m 20s --> 113m 25s
for example of making every last bit of

113m 30s --> 113m 35s
world um and in a little transaction one for

113m 35s --> 113m 40s
well I'm going to a motel for the night if ur mama Sita place

113m 45s --> 113m 50s
I'm just waking the firm so this is going to be

113m 50s --> 113m 55s
running I will get to get to the final today D in a second I'm gonna be

114m 00s --> 114m 05s
well this league

114m 05s --> 114m 10s
0 why don't I don't 460 so you just keep going

114m 15s --> 114m 20s
ok great um another use

114m 20s --> 114m 25s
the four again to run because for the lazy I need to 415 happened

114m 30s --> 114m 35s
that would really you know him down the world the writing transactions

114m 35s --> 114m 40s
so but I don't really care of the foot the evaporator everything so I can do a little job lot

114m 45s --> 114m 50s
elephant higher simulation logic um up there sup

114m 50s --> 114m 55s
let's have fun UI I need to do some job stuff to do some you I love

115m 00s --> 115m 05s
pollen Jolla yes to the same job

115m 05s --> 115m 10s
dollar um I know what is by 80 w 220 for c5

115m 15s --> 115m 20s
uh and then I'm going to go under the sea

115m 20s --> 115m 25s
backwards from render the closure of revising the fighting for the you

115m 30s --> 115m 35s
uh which is that we're going to be getting a graphics contacts

115m 35s --> 115m 40s
the ideas does a painting friend Nicole's you

115m 45s --> 115m 50s
and uh so the cool thing about renters what is the

115m 50s --> 115m 55s
when is the paper whole world

116m 00s --> 116m 05s
Rutherford Boulevard Android

116m 05s --> 116m 10s
whole world but it only has to read the whole world

116m 15s --> 116m 20s
play cancellation what is a really hard problem is a bit of a written out the whole bunch of stuff

116m 20s --> 116m 25s
I like a report I want to sure that nobody present two places at once

116m 30s --> 116m 35s
in order to have a valid report everything figured I guess what

116m 35s --> 116m 40s
Tim does this kind of stuff and that's a very very hard thing to do so what do we do we may

116m 45s --> 116m 50s
like that know what to say about transaction

116m 50s --> 116m 55s
you when you read the transaction everything you read is as if

117m 00s --> 117m 05s
around and evaporated map reading thing this

117m 05s --> 117m 10s
is going to get a consistent view the world what does this do you think

117m 15s --> 117m 20s
Universal crisscross van if you can see the ass they would all be there

117m 20s --> 117m 25s
and you have to trust me on that but but thats thats the deal so

117m 30s --> 117m 35s
so we're going to create a transaction and we're going to

117m 35s --> 117m 40s
through every place right off the whole range and I play

117m 45s --> 117m 50s
popular the map right because they're never going to change open references in a second

118m 00s --> 118m 05s
while this is happening right everything is changing

118m 05s --> 118m 10s
that's right I mean

118m 15s --> 118m 20s
do that the old weigh in the loop way right I would I would pick up Rihanna

118m 20s --> 118m 25s
NP that cigarette and pay that I would know that every paper I kal hum

118m 30s --> 118m 35s
tennis world all kinds of things well the other

118m 35s --> 118m 40s
pretty consistent behavior branches take longer than others

118m 45s --> 118m 50s
rent so is it really is the notion of brain brain brain for free in the activity

118m 50s --> 118m 55s
so we really have it in Tennessee after the world is animation

119m 00s --> 119m 05s
the real world supposed to have the reporting you have this problem of and if that will work

119m 05s --> 119m 10s
did you have a very difficult problem I have yet to see of elegant solution

119m 15s --> 119m 20s
don't have the copious login and Pine Point Sunday we create things

119m 20s --> 119m 25s
backwards so we talk in the world very quick

119m 30s --> 119m 35s
fling stuff really great buffet image which is not where were drawing

119m 35s --> 119m 40s
create a image there right of due to the way to do mobile opera

119m 45s --> 119m 50s
text color block .bz for Xbox like they do to BJs

119m 50s --> 119m 55s
30 gallons of ice at the back of all the way I feel a recipe

120m 00s --> 120m 05s
the rest of the place for functional say um and then uh

120m 05s --> 120m 10s
we're going to go and crazy uh a box around home in blue

120m 15s --> 120m 20s
second then we draw a rectangle around home and uh

120m 20s --> 120m 25s
then we be off then we take a buffer damaged we put it into the panel

120m 30s --> 120m 35s
that makes it animation supposed to join while you're showing in mini golf liquor

120m 35s --> 120m 40s
I slept render surrender call Brenda place

120m 45s --> 120m 50s
graphic place and that's why location is this for Mon there

120m 50s --> 120m 55s
Green Knight's Tale by the motor for motor in FL fact I said before

121m 00s --> 121m 05s
uh then we have rendered

121m 05s --> 121m 10s
um this is more complicated for leaving you Fabolous but the bottom line is

121m 15s --> 121m 20s
nude or black bf doesnt it's pointing in the directions believe me that's not very

121m 20s --> 121m 25s
looking like a #### about your desk for the a

121m 30s --> 121m 35s
tell sell is a function is a cigarette is this interesting thing right here

121m 35s --> 121m 40s
we have seen before which is shark carrot this is off

121m 45s --> 121m 50s
okay um so this is the method in a little this is this is meta data

121m 50s --> 121m 55s
being supplied to the compiler on this is associating the medicine

122m 00s --> 122m 05s
policies that says this she's going to be representing a graphics

122m 05s --> 122m 10s
and we haven't seen any type so far

122m 15s --> 122m 20s
given Justin this is a graphic all the code in here will not use reflect

122m 20s --> 122m 25s
will generate call job that do not use reflection on and you'll see the

122m 30s --> 122m 35s
RAM NFL Texas Ren fest enough to work given the

122m 35s --> 122m 40s
traffic that knows this signature the functions of the called directly north

122m 45s --> 122m 50s
local cell reference winterplace

122m 50s --> 122m 55s
when do the whole world uh

123m 00s --> 123m 05s
that's a graphics thingy right

123m 05s --> 123m 10s
econo paint I just to find an instance of a drive

123m 15s --> 123m 20s
that's all it takes is a proxy you put Baltimore of War 1

123m 20s --> 123m 25s
and one more interface 01 interfaces you get a proxy class to find

123m 30s --> 123m 35s
um closures in here of that define the

123m 35s --> 123m 40s
console really care about paint paint the past like I said paint job function now

123m 45s --> 123m 50s
the function so this this lil between here and there is all Texas

123m 50s --> 123m 55s
define a drive Java class in closer NFL Blitz

124m 00s --> 124m 05s
preferred size so do to the new product

124m 05s --> 124m 10s
is the preferred size the mansion um okay

124m 15s --> 124m 20s
a friend is making New Jersey frame so also used

124m 20s --> 124m 25s
Bethany this is a multiple lines do to a new J frame

124m 30s --> 124m 35s
cool have a call that

124m 35s --> 124m 40s
babe I just hit up

124m 45s --> 124m 50s
oh and the end we put on it before

124m 50s --> 124m 55s
so I am I pregnant

125m 00s --> 125m 05s
so much fun

125m 05s --> 125m 10s
like I said so duh

125m 15s --> 125m 20s
I like that uh now he's a citizen's part right like nothing happened

125m 20s --> 125m 25s
populated it right with call setup and uh

125m 30s --> 125m 35s
click at we saw the behavior of function which is the name of apts

125m 35s --> 125m 40s
of the an agent I want to go to have an animation agency

125m 45s --> 125m 50s
so what will make an agent for that and it really is a beautiful state for animators is a

125m 50s --> 125m 55s
McMillan Zaza's releases to perform side effects

126m 00s --> 126m 05s
now isn't a call re paint and sleep

126m 05s --> 126m 10s
that's what the animation action and then there's another

126m 15s --> 126m 20s
operator and his the Nexus Valparaiso Indiana is going to call

126m 20s --> 126m 25s
map rate and then sleep okay

126m 30s --> 126m 35s
where is an activity for him where to find the behavior for um

126m 35s --> 126m 40s
Asian bunch of those so now we see this run

126m 45s --> 126m 50s
chess a good I forgot to tell you something funny with a load the file um

126m 50s --> 126m 55s
but I'm not going to what happened uh

127m 00s --> 127m 05s
going okay which is this is now worth I'd behave

127m 05s --> 127m 10s
15 Haven

127m 15s --> 127m 20s
please send an action send off to star is in star

127m 20s --> 127m 25s
are Asian store is this is a totally running anything

127m 30s --> 127m 35s
action which means going to be called an agent which means this value of

127m 35s --> 127m 40s
is it will be down in Assassin's to the agent

127m 45s --> 127m 50s
the same function do it again the beach

127m 50s --> 127m 55s
Asian is going to be told to do something and that's when he doesn't

128m 00s --> 128m 05s
this message in action inside an actual wanted to go off f

128m 05s --> 128m 10s
is there a change is gonna have a note of this point the code

128m 15s --> 128m 20s
Big O level is running a stroke similarly

128m 20s --> 128m 25s
if we now looking for to look at the animation think the same thing

128m 30s --> 128m 35s
and evaporated of the same thing is going to be in if it looks

128m 35s --> 128m 40s
open by running okay so far

128m 45s --> 128m 50s
um wish I didn't talk about the bars get bound thread locally any agencies

128m 50s --> 128m 55s
find the VAR star asian star the currently executing agent

129m 00s --> 129m 05s
functions of this state really have access to the reference accept this way

129m 05s --> 129m 10s
is a nice way to do it because most functions of Asians are really

129m 15s --> 129m 20s
Pendlay by making the functions of data that supposed to function of references

129m 30s --> 129m 35s
I'm going to send the evaporator the operation at in in a minute

129m 35s --> 129m 40s
they're not connected A OK

129m 45s --> 129m 50s
file to see if I actually got everything so off we remember

129m 50s --> 129m 55s
don't know if you remember but up at the top we call setup right setup distributive

130m 00s --> 130m 05s
the FBI agent so I call setup I'd like to try

130m 05s --> 130m 10s
finance to do that here Sonic call setup

130m 15s --> 130m 20s
so what the f buy lottery

130m 20s --> 130m 25s
cool so we have 49 incision

130m 30s --> 130m 35s
send the animator the action animation rumor actually

130m 35s --> 130m 40s
ocean the animators an agent recreation before send him

130m 45s --> 130m 50s
cool is an email um

130m 50s --> 130m 55s
price of the thread count before whats a

131m 00s --> 131m 05s
okay so but there was a threat

131m 05s --> 131m 10s
is a metros running the Saturday silly but um um nothing is changed

131m 15s --> 131m 20s
run map of lazy so if I said map this function across the answer would

131m 20s --> 131m 25s
who do the first one but I never confirmed the result none of the other side effects

131m 30s --> 131m 35s
mapping send off to this and behaves a quickie

131m 35s --> 131m 40s
of function literal for sending

131m 45s --> 131m 50s
have 10 so uh

131m 50s --> 131m 55s
cool Lego um and then we will go

132m 00s --> 132m 05s
uh uh look here woohoo now we're never stop 6868

132m 05s --> 132m 10s
um we're using 100 percent CPU which means we are

132m 15s --> 132m 20s
and there we go infrared remember when they have food

132m 20s --> 132m 25s
so this rather than from the greens from on build up uh

132m 30s --> 132m 35s
open for programming in closer no lock

132m 35s --> 132m 40s
umm some of what's happening here would be extremely difficult

132m 45s --> 132m 50s
its gotta be consistent view the world but it's a little later

132m 50s --> 132m 55s
I really think about world the first things live without stopping right

133m 00s --> 133m 05s
typing jobs running in the background of a chance looking at a set of

133m 05s --> 133m 10s
set of places make decisions about what to do both sets of

133m 15s --> 133m 20s
play running women transactions of the constraints of the system's logic

133m 20s --> 133m 25s
4th so no two at the same place um No

133m 30s --> 133m 35s
drawing is not in peace by the emotion out of your body about poration

133m 35s --> 133m 40s
there's 51 thread

133m 50s --> 133m 55s
echo

134m 00s --> 134m 05s
are you

134m 05s --> 134m 10s
pull behind a oh okay so yes

134m 15s --> 134m 20s
cool uh directions to thread pools in is a system

134m 20s --> 134m 25s
a1 is um used by the functions send

134m 30s --> 134m 35s
awesome multiple of huh

134m 35s --> 134m 40s
that's a multiple of the process was late is the number for us

134m 45s --> 134m 50s
a red per request and the ideas that

134m 50s --> 134m 55s
if you had requested my block your back is on my block you can consume your friend

135m 00s --> 135m 05s
piece of this and throat are sleeping

135m 05s --> 135m 10s
sleep walking in the right thing to do is use end of Avengers you send off

135m 15s --> 135m 20s
baller seminar for sale it will be waiting in the Sierras

135m 20s --> 135m 25s
Fred and get exactly the same behavior um

135m 30s --> 135m 35s
have locking up aration if you only have a thread for operation

135m 35s --> 135m 40s
Ticketmaster fishing report most efficient way to what question

135m 45s --> 135m 50s
you could you know you could use a hug for transactions on

135m 50s --> 135m 55s
you could also put closure functions into the executor framework a job lot

136m 00s --> 136m 05s
bob is a pretty high power tools with very of low

136m 05s --> 136m 10s
overhead view all we did was put think around stuff

136m 15s --> 136m 20s
restaurants close

136m 30s --> 136m 35s
player uh

136m 35s --> 136m 40s
yeah you can find out really what I want to say is a go to closure

136m 45s --> 136m 50s
babe way we communicate Desire C is also a

136m 50s --> 136m 55s
blip.tv which is the place where I put screencast like maybe I'll put the

137m 00s --> 137m 05s
case um about I am doing a series of things like that

137m 05s --> 137m 10s
again ugh prep all the flies in of America

137m 15s --> 137m 20s
the right thing after the wiki um with TV with has a bunch

137m 20s --> 137m 25s
talk to give a non sequences in the other cord is for closers like #### scratch

137m 30s --> 137m 35s
what lunch time

137m 35s --> 137m 40s
yes um

137m 45s --> 137m 50s
yes yes

137m 50s --> 137m 55s
ok put your does not yet have a distributed of concurrency store

138m 00s --> 138m 05s
primitive with distribution and the trade-offs associated with that

138m 05s --> 138m 10s
um it makes it transparent a distribution at least in Mexico

138m 15s --> 138m 20s
machine and it will work in practice of

138m 20s --> 138m 25s
there are behavioral differences to moving to the pharmacy which is that if you were sent

138m 30s --> 138m 35s
under some good papers from Sun I think that are critical of transparent distribution

138m 35s --> 138m 40s
I have to be sympathetic with those papers um but I think the problem and they were in there

138m 45s --> 138m 50s
is that all of your failure modes are tell you about the distributor

138m 50s --> 138m 55s
what are the worst Valley Road they have to go to some of

139m 00s --> 139m 05s
with a distributed system the other major difference I would say between

139m 05s --> 139m 10s
actors of upper Lancaster legs really after system

139m 15s --> 139m 20s
there's no access to after state except by a message send

139m 20s --> 139m 25s
enough because that's the only thing to distribute a closure agent state is

139m 30s --> 139m 35s
so the trailer there I find that the ease of use a programming with direct

139m 35s --> 139m 40s
so that state is worth nothing wishing to the two systems

139m 45s --> 139m 50s
of messaging system for in process so that's why I didn't closer anticipate

139m 50s --> 139m 55s
I just ripped a distributed of system for closure

140m 00s --> 140m 05s
correct it'll be like a fourth I don't know if I'll even feel like

140m 05s --> 140m 10s
references because it was important maybe easier to um

140m 15s --> 140m 20s
but that does the trade off so that's why I said the agent on after the third

140m 20s --> 140m 25s
off and they're strictly not better or worse there their trade offs

140m 35s --> 140m 40s
huh

140m 50s --> 140m 55s
well its not the same me to sleep what they do is they

141m 00s --> 141m 05s
tolerate process is dying and there

141m 05s --> 141m 10s
Garden that's how they keep running in her life I'm here this will literally kill

141m 15s --> 141m 20s
is an actor is waiting in the message to put things in it to the painted have

141m 20s --> 141m 25s
Benson write your loop you gotta love hehehe

141m 30s --> 141m 35s
I can't right now send a different a new to access to any of these agents

141m 35s --> 141m 40s
ironic that never knew about it was like a find function that's ok that's a function of the day

141m 45s --> 141m 50s
then I'm waiting to be told drop food like knows way too cold you'll fall down

141m 50s --> 141m 55s
forget it over the head sew in simulations I think your building something that knows

142m 00s --> 142m 05s
the system process of starting with the new function so they have code

142m 05s --> 142m 10s
bring it into a process regeneration of weather

142m 15s --> 142m 20s
well I'm not

142m 20s --> 142m 25s
good graphics

142m 30s --> 142m 35s
take a note red green blue and purple right

142m 45s --> 142m 50s
Ohio purple

142m 50s --> 142m 55s
okay um no problem no problem

143m 00s --> 143m 05s
is this a while running on buildings instantly you

143m 05s --> 143m 10s
and is a woman start stop edge rock third state

143m 15s --> 143m 20s
water line but in all these things are a little disappointed

143m 20s --> 143m 25s
is about choosing between trade off not right a wrong um so

143m 30s --> 143m 35s
on the other hand uh I would find it extremely tedious the house

143m 35s --> 143m 40s
us to wait for messages in order to read state of Asian and

143m 45s --> 143m 50s
because you have to set up on a sin is a sin I'm waiting for you to reply back to me

143m 50s --> 143m 55s
go to the nested I'm waiting for a response from from Fred as possible to write

144m 00s --> 144m 05s
zing strictly for synchronization in order to read somebody's State you don't need that

144m 05s --> 144m 10s
um so it's a little bit of a different in every way there are

144m 15s --> 144m 20s
barcode loading chart James B rivers of the running

144m 30s --> 144m 35s
correct that's one reason why the bars

144m 35s --> 144m 40s
for a beautiful at the root globally

144m 45s --> 144m 50s
don't do that that's def

144m 50s --> 144m 55s
did to do that I cycle def def means a stablished this is the meaning of this

145m 00s --> 145m 05s
you're not allowed so in programs in message contacts when you want to call cell

145m 05s --> 145m 10s
you better have a friend looking bunny or without so yes definitely

145m 15s --> 145m 20s
you catch the right thing with set but def is it is an absolute idea I'm know what I'm doing on

145m 20s --> 145m 25s
the world of the same for everybody on nm the only real

145m 30s --> 145m 35s
I'm the happiest something that's terrible like that

145m 35s --> 145m 40s
as of the rude I've ours on my way

146m 05s --> 146m 10s
um I would hope not I mean I would really love for Jonathan not change it all in

146m 15s --> 146m 20s
complex they make my interrupt job more complex um but I

146m 20s --> 146m 25s
but I do think that cetera fundamental problems with languages like job in that

146m 30s --> 146m 35s
send a for do the right thing and even then you're like a job

146m 35s --> 146m 40s
concurrency but if you do that and you don't have like a persistent

146m 45s --> 146m 50s
the means to copy them off so its a big is a bigger story

146m 50s --> 146m 55s
and use the closure class library from Java it's a very nice class library

147m 00s --> 147m 05s
can you can use all the same job

147m 05s --> 147m 10s
that use all the closer

147m 15s --> 147m 20s
from: alarm

147m 20s --> 147m 25s
uh I've been working a closer for a couple years

147m 30s --> 147m 35s
for 45 of a close are the language ephedra

147m 35s --> 147m 40s
Genesis mean if it supports the shop for a while it was a compiler

147m 45s --> 147m 50s
holy over the summer that I decided to us stop supporting

147m 50s --> 147m 55s
um dot net and try to focus on compilation

148m 00s --> 148m 05s
print annoyingly different but not appreciably different um but I decided

148m 05s --> 148m 10s
if I could end it's greatly federated of the completion of closure uh send it up

148m 15s --> 148m 20s
library so about Bowl I'm completely happy with with worth

148m 20s --> 148m 25s
but it's a huge amount of work that thing with closure whats the compiler

148m 30s --> 148m 35s
can close your four in the destruction binding those things are already in closure

148m 35s --> 148m 40s
add for you could have at it for a system acro destruction is also

148m 45s --> 148m 50s
a super primitive list what has if set

148m 50s --> 148m 55s
Oh a deaf and the Lambada fun

149m 00s --> 149m 05s
the language is written in closer Elizabeth out the old jail

149m 05s --> 149m 10s
or of a language South construction when is defined condo

149m 15s --> 149m 20s
but a big part of this class library with huge job persistent destruction

149m 20s --> 149m 25s
big deal and there a court underpinning

149m 30s --> 149m 35s
missed because of the list compiler

149m 45s --> 149m 50s
very fast uh give you should find it faster than

149m 50s --> 149m 55s
iPhone repair 500 Smith come out and up

150m 00s --> 150m 05s
puzzle box and closer I'm calling speech vehicle into Java

150m 05s --> 150m 10s
I mean on my desktop machine I can make a million

150m 15s --> 150m 20s
real applications assistant instructors are in striking distance of old

150m 20s --> 150m 25s
Java data structures and that's with a factor of two to

150m 30s --> 150m 35s
and the hits just try thinking about that was part of the way you would have

150m 35s --> 150m 40s
you're with cells that you would change in place a lock

150m 45s --> 150m 50s
this render is snapshot of the world well it couldn't have those cells road

150m 50s --> 150m 55s
if those map inside the cells really change but they're not writing swapped out

151m 00s --> 151m 05s
scales up globally to the way you think about running programs

151m 05s --> 151m 10s
when you know your data can never change of mind if you everything is different

151m 15s --> 151m 20s
if you don't track your trail is this the causeway and then was the other

151m 20s --> 151m 25s
things are just think about #### job with a language the ephemeral garbage collection in Java

151m 30s --> 151m 35s
free offer since the the sequence of operation closer

151m 35s --> 151m 40s
which is like con Edison abstraction when you use a fax

151m 45s --> 151m 50s
cheap its just the point about it because it all ends up in a gin

151m 50s --> 151m 55s
0 uh it's nothing to do you say and and I all the things

152m 00s --> 152m 05s
code of so I was really good

152m 15s --> 152m 20s
work with the food around home

152m 20s --> 152m 25s
yeah I can actually say that they would have been up there be around with

152m 30s --> 152m 35s
suck bang into each other like the first few times

152m 35s --> 152m 40s
uh well thank you I really appreciate you

152m 50s --> 152m 55s
I did a google search and I had 0 hits

153m 00s --> 153m 05s
gonna have a good logo

153m 05s --> 153m 10s
it has it alright alright pizza
