Hi!

2
00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:04.700
Welcome

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.575
Thank you all for waiting

4
00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Rich Hickey and I'm here to talk about 

5
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:11.812
Clojure

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.648
It's a program language

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.648
I developed to solve a number of problems

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.852
One of wich was organize cocnorent programs easily

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:37.485
So, tonight, talking has a be a general review of clojure and specific look at some of the correny support let sponsed by a language

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:37.485
So, I gonna siricly introduction

11
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:50.000
As I say I give a quick tutorial of the features
But on of them really would like to do tonight is look at peace of software written in clojure.

12
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:53.486
And so I'd likked, hopefully,  


Get Will true my slides , so it ideas 
show an you behind I will show an your


And look at some code 
Hopefully more apartunity looking to syntatic in clojure. And feature 
Lookead at this programm. We will thinks in the action.

16
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.909
So, Quick feature tutorial

17
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:25.385
Then I will setup so a problem space in particular talk about shared state. How it doing today? How it doing in C#, Java, C++?

18
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:36.263
What happens when we get a multi-threading context and specifically what a some current solution for that in all spaces. 

19
You know, lockers in particular.

20
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.136
That somethink are done a lot of over a long period of time.

And, I'm 

We got it a simply far to difficult

00:03:43.89
python, ruby, groovy

How an multi-threading programming?
