Hi!

2
00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:04.700
Welcome

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.575
Thank you all for waiting

4
00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Rich Hickey and I'm here to talk about 

5
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:11.812
Clojure

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.648
It's a program language

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.648
I developed to solve a number of problems

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.852
One of which was [organized?] concurrent programs easily

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:37.485
So, tonight, talks is gone a be so a general review of clojure and specific look at some of the concurrency support that sponsed by a language

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:37.485
So, I gonna siricly introduction

11
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:50.000
As I say I give a quick tutorial of the features
But on of them really would like to do tonight is look at peace software written in clojure.

12
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:53.486
[And so I'd likked, hopefully, if I can we move to good place.]

13
Get Will true my slides , so an ideas 
show an you behind I will show an your

14
And look at some code 

15
--> 00:01:13.097
Hopefully more apartunity looking to syntatic in clojure. And feature 
Lookead at this programm. We will thinks in the action.

16
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.909
So, quick feature tutorial.

17
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:25.385
Then [I will] setup so a problem space in particular talk about shared state. How is doing today? How is doing in C#, Java, C++?

18
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:36.263
What happens when we get to a multi-threading context and specifically what a some the current solution for that in all spaces. 

19
You know, lockers in particular.

20
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.136
That somethink are done a lot of over a long period of time.

21
And, I'm 

22
--> 00:01:50.435
We got it a simply far to difficult

23
00:03:43.89
tern wat a clojure does.

24
And cool little ant simulation with multi-threading graphic components
hard to correctly almost common languages

25
So, I'm soft developed

26
python, ruby, groovy

27
How an multi-threading programming?
